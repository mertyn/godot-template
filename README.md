# project setup (windows/non-nixos)
- download godot 4.2.1 (regular, no .net/c#) 
	- for better management and easier starting, using [scoop](https://scoop.sh/#/apps?q=godot&id=2fdd7b453f1ef3161d01986e2051c646911a642c) or [chocolatey](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/godot) is recommended on windows
	- otherwise download from [godotengine.org](https://godotengine.org/download) 
- code editor (optional, but nicer): vscode (or vscodium) works best, extensions for godot are provided
- clone repository
- start godot, import project (select `src/` directory)
- when using vscode/vscodium
	- go to extensions and search `@recommended`
	- click download all button
	- on the lower right, check if language server is connected (godot editor needs to be running)
