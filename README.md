# project setup
- download godot 4.2.1 (regular, no .net/c#) from [godotengine.org](https://godotengine.org/download)
- code editor (optional, but nicer): vscode (or vscodium) works best, extension for godot are provided
- clone repository
- start godot, import project (select `src/` directory)
- when using vscode/vscodium
	- go to extensions and search `@recommended`
	- click download all button
	- on the lower right, check if language server is connected (godot editor needs to be running)
